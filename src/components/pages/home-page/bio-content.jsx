            Hi, my name is Damon, and I am originally from Australia. I grew up all over the world living in Australia, France, United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan and more recently the United States. <br/><br/>
            I grew up playing tennis, and that was the main reason for moving to the US. I was recruited to play tennis for James Madison University and had such a great experience.<br/><br/>
            I absolutely discovered my niche in my concluding year of university when I had been exposed to programming. I developed a deep passion for programming, and since, I have been completely committed to becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer.<br/><br/>
            Being that we were in a pandemic at the start of 2020, I thought it would be a fantastic opportunity to learn all there is about Web Development. Presently, six months have passed, and I feel utterly confident to create any type of website and love the process.<br/><br/>
            My favorite thing is being capable to mix creative and analytical to develop beautiful websites. Also, programming and Web Development gives the opportunity of continuous learning and growth.
